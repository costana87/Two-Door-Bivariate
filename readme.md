The name of this project and map is Two-Door-Bivariate. This map is a bivariate map that shows the 2023 population of each state with the locations one of my favorite bands (Two Door Ciname Club) concert locations for their upcoming tour. Some of the main functions of this map are to highlight the looations of the tour and give insight in to the location. Included with the venue's location is the status of the venue being an indoor or outdoor venue. The symbolization then separates these two factors to show which venues are indoor and outdoor at a quick glance. The data source I used to find tour locations was just from the bands website and the way I determined if the venues were indoor or outdoor was by veiwing them on google and google images. To find the US state population data I found the census data from 2023 on a census website.
